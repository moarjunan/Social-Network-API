# Social Network API

Backend for a social network app

Bootcamp Challenge 18: NoSQL

## Description

This application marks the inception of a comprehensive full-stack social network, leveraging a MongoDB database, Express.js routing, and the Mongoose ODM. It establishes the foundational CRUD API routes for the application, enabling the creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of users. Additionally, users can engage in various activities such as sharing thoughts, reacting to friends' thoughts, managing a friend list, and performing actions like deleting thoughts, reactions, friends, and even their own user profile. While the application is in its early stages, laying the groundwork with MongoDB and API middleware routing serves as a crucial initial exploration into the capabilities of MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM.
